Plan of Action
==============

1. Implement the hough transform circle counting using the ground truth images given to us.
2. Implement the filters, trying out different settings.
3. Run ROC analysis on each image with different combinations of filters to determine which combination is best. Plot graphs in MATLAB, scatter graph?
4. Write the report â€“ Aim, Method, Results, Conclusions.
